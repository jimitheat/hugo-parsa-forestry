What is Sports Revue?

Sports Revue is a show about our Sporting Heros gathering together provide humour entertainment without the Political correctness. 

As with all sports, there are always those that are less fortunate than the heros. Sporting Heros provide energy and leadership to those less fortunate. 

But with all organisations and Charity there needs to be a system to support this change/challenge. 

Currently the back end system for supporting events are archaic and slow. Sports revue looks at changing all of this with the funding to support an efficient system to distribute charity funds and tickets. 

The project looks to also incorporate some form of DLT to manage this ticketing system and NFTs to capture the Sports Revue show for those less fortunate to watch the show. 

This idea was produced on the 10th of June
